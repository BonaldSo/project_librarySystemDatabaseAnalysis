Project_databaseAnalysis

In this project, a prototype of the suggested database schema will be created by
MySQL server. Testing mainly focuses on the correctness of field type, primary key
constraint, foreign key constraint and DBMS built-in data validation. As the
application program is not the scope of this project, user interface design, algorithm
design, program coding, program testing & debugging will not be included in this
task.
